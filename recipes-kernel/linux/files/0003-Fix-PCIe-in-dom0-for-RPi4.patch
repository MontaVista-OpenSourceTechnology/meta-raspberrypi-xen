Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Fix PCIe in dom0 for RPi4

There is an issue where the Broadcom PCIe driver and Xen swiotlb layer
invoke each other's dma alloc function recursively until the stack blows
up. The cause appears to be due to arch_setup_dma_ops being called
more than once for the device, possibly through of_dma_configure, and
screwing up the dma_ops pointers. This patch adds a check to make sure
that the xen_dma_ops are applied only once for a device.
